At the moment, I'm writing my own Registration Manager for the Tyros 3 in Java. Therefore, I examine the .RGT-files with a HEX-editor and summarize my results in a specification for these files.

You can find the basic structure of an .RGT-file here: http://www.heikoplate.de/pdf/tyros_registrationfiles_deutsch.pdf. Heiko Plate did a great job in analyzing the structure of these files, however lots of functions are missing there. That's why I examined them on my own and by this time, I can already state which byte(s) stand(s) for which functionalities for most of the functions on the Tyros 3 (althought only a very small part is already implemented in my program).

 You can download the current .jar file by clicking on the link below.
The program is not yet finished and has currently only a few functionalities. Moreover, it is still sensitive to some errors, so don't be surprised if something won't work.
I hope you like it anyway.
